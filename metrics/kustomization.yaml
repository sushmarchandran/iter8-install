########## 
# Kubernetes stacks are specified in three places: 
#
# 1. the resources array field in core/rbac/stacks/kustomization.yaml,
# 2. the resources array field in metrics/kustomization.yaml file (this file), and
# 3. the resources array field in prometheus-add-on/service-monitors/kustomization.file
# 
# By default, Iter8 will install manifests corresponding to all the stacks.
#
# To change selectively turn off stacks, comment out the corresponding resources
# in these three files.

# By default, the URLTempalate for Iter8 metrics that are installed 'out-of-the-box'
# point to the Prometheus instance installed as part of the prometheus-add-on.
# 
# If you chose not to install the Prometheus add-on and choose to use 
# your own Prometheus instance, or 
# if you kustomized the Iter8 installation namespace, 
# you may need to kustomize the URLTemplate for Iter8 metrics during installation. 
#
# To supply a different Prometheus URL Iter8 metrics installed 'out-of-the-box', 
# uncomment the following lines and replace the urlTemplate value with 
# the URL of your Prometheus service
